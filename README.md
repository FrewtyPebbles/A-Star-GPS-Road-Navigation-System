# GPS Road Navigation System

This GPS Road System will find the (hopefully) shortest path to a destination using the A* graph traversal algorithm.  The graph is designed to use data from [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org).

The dataset we used specifically was from [this page](https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/us/california.html).  If you would like to download the dataset directly you can do so from [this link](https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/us/california-251205.osm.pbf).
